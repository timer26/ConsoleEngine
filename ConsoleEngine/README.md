## ConsoleEngine

this is my attemt to create console engine that can render and manage scenes.
trying to mimic gameEngines.
but can be useful as base for any console base application.
#### feel free to use it or even contribute 

### current state
- implemented basic scene management.
- some basic rendering.
- some basic containers
- basic input handling
- containers cannot be nested, and if so it requires manual positioning and sizing.
